# `geoarrow-rs`

A Rust implementation of the [GeoArrow](https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow) specification and bindings to [GeoRust algorithms](https://github.com/georust/geo) for efficient spatial operations on GeoArrow memory.

This repository also includes [JavaScript (WebAssembly) bindings](https://github.com/kylebarron/geoarrow-rs/blob/main/js/README.md), wrapping the GeoArrow memory layout and offering vectorized geometry operations.

## Documentation

- Rust library <https://docs.rs/geoarrow2/latest/geoarrow2/>
- JavaScript library: <https://kylebarron.dev/geoarrow-rs/js>
- Rust wasm-bindgen library: <https://docs.rs/geoarrow-wasm/latest/geoarrow_wasm/>

## Examples

- [Rust examples](examples/README.md)

## Install

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
geoarrow = { package = "geoarrow2", version = "0.1" }
```

This will let you reference the package name as `geoarrow` in your code, even though the name on Crates.io is `geoarrow2`. Sadly the name `geoarrow` is [squatted on by an empty package](https://crates.io/crates/geoarrow).
