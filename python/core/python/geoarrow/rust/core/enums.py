    ## Assumptions

    - Polygons are assumed to be wound in a counter-clockwise direction for the exterior
      ring and a clockwise direction for interior rings. This is the standard winding
      for geometries that follow the Simple Feature standard. Alternative windings may
      result in a negative area. See "Interpreting negative area values" below.
    - Polygons are assumed to be smaller than half the size of the earth. If you expect
      to be dealing with polygons larger than this, please use the `unsigned` methods.

    ## Units

    - return value: meter²

    ## Interpreting negative area values

    A negative value can mean one of two things:

    1. The winding of the polygon is in the clockwise direction (reverse winding). If
       this is the case, and you know the polygon is smaller than half the area of
       earth, you can take the absolute value of the reported area to get the correct
       area.
    2. The polygon is larger than half the planet. In this case, the returned area of
       the polygon is not correct. If you expect to be dealing with very large polygons,
       please use the `unsigned` methods.

    The topology-preserving algorithm uses an R* tree to efficiently find candidate line

    are found, the previous point (i.e. the left component of the current triangle) is
    also removed, altering the geometry and removing the intersection.

    # Notes

    - It is possible for the simplification algorithm to displace a Polygon's interior
      ring outside its shell.
    - The algorithm does **not** guarantee a valid output geometry, especially on
      smaller geometries.
    - If removal of a point causes a self-intersection, but the geometry only has `n +
      1` points remaining (3 for a `LineString`, 5 for a `Polygon`), the point is
      retained and the simplification process ends. This is because there is no
      guarantee that removal of two points will remove the intersection, but removal of
      further points would leave too few points to form a valid geometry.
    - The tolerance used to remove a point is `epsilon`, in keeping with GEOS. JTS uses
      `epsilon ^ 2`
