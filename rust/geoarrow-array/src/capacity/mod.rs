//! Counters for managing buffer lengths for each geometry array type.
//!
//! The most memory-efficient way to construct an array from a set of geometries is to make a
//! first pass over these geometries to count exactly how big each underlying buffer of the Arrow
//! array must be, allocate _once_ for exactly what you need, and then fill those buffers in a
//! second pass. Capacity counters help with this process.
